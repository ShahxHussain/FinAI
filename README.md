SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = "your_snowflake_account"
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE = "your_snowflake_warehouse"
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE = "your_snowflake_database"
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA = "your_snowflake_schema"
```

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Detailed Setup

### API Configuration

#### Together.ai Setup
1. Visit [Together.ai](https://together.ai)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `tk-`)

#### Snowflake Setup

2. Sign up for a free trial (30 days, $400 credit)
3. Choose your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
4. Select a region close to you
5. Create your account

### Database Setup

#### 1. Get Connection Details
- **Account URL**: Look at your browser URL when logged in
- **Format**: `https://your-account.snowflakecomputing.com`
- **Account Identifier**: `your-account`

#### 2. Create Database Objects
Run these SQL commands in Snowflake console:

```sql
-- Create Warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS FINAI_WH
WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Create Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS FINAI_DB;

-- Create Schema
USE DATABASE FINAI_DB;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS FINAI_SCHEMA;

```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Date Format Errors
**Error: "time data '06-Jul-2025' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d'"**
- ✅ **Fixed**: The application now supports multiple date formats automatically
- Supported formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD-MMM-YYYY`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `YYYY/MM/DD`
- If date parsing fails, the system defaults to current date


#### Snowflake Connection Problems
**Error: "Failed to initialize database"**
```bash
# Check warehouse status
ALTER WAREHOUSE FINAI_WH RESUME;

# Verify connection details
# Ensure account identifier is correct
```

**Error: "Authentication failed"**
- Double-check username and password
- Verify account identifier format
- Test login via Snowflake console

#### Together.ai API Issues
**Error: "TOGETHER_API_KEY not found"**
- Check if API key is in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- Verify API key format (starts with `tk-`)
- Test API key on Together.ai console

#### Python Dependencies
**Error: "Module not found"**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
```


### Performance Optimization

#### Snowflake Cost Management
```sql
-- Suspend warehouse when not in use
ALTER WAREHOUSE FINAI_WH SUSPEND;

-- Resume when needed
ALTER WAREHOUSE FINAI_WH RESUME;

-- Monitor usage
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY(
    DATE_RANGE_START=>DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_DATE()),
    DATE_RANGE_END=>CURRENT_DATE()
));
```
